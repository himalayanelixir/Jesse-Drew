##  1. <a name='Summary'></a>Summary
This project was originally created by Jesse and Glenda Drew, professors at UC Davis to redesign an mechanical animation machine built on Arduino. The project was originally started in 2015 and a version 1 delivered in early 2016. It was awful though. Working on this again in 2020.
